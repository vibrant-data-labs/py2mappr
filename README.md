py2mappr: data visualization
=====================================

Py2Mappr is a python library to generate [openmappr player](https://github.com/vibrant-data-labs/openmappr-player) from node and links files.

It provides a simple API to generate a map from a set of nodes and links. The API is designed to be flexible and extensible. It is also designed to be used in a pipeline. The output of the library is a self contained folder with all the resources necessary to render a map.

## Installing
At the moment the library is not available on pypi. There are two ways to install the library:

1. Install from the GitHub repository

        pip install git+https://github.com/vibrant-data-labs/py2mappr

2. Clone the repository and install as a editable package

        git clone <py2mappr-repo>
        pip install -r _requirements.txt
        cd <project>
        pip install -e <path-to-py2mappr>

### Dependencies

#### Supported Python Versions

* Python 3.8+

#### External Dependencies

* numpy
* pandas
* [tag2network](https://github.com/vibrant-data-labs/tag2network)
* boto3 (optional) - for uploading to s3, interacting with cloudfront distributions
* requests (optional) - for interacting with cloudflare API

## Getting started

Py2Mappr accepts the datapoints and network data in the form of `pandas.DataFrame`
    
        import pandas as pd
        from py2mappr import mappr
    
        # read the data
        nodes = pd.read_csv("nodes.csv")
        links = pd.read_csv("links.csv")
    
        # create the map
        mappr.create_map(nodes, links)

        # display player in the browser
        mappr.show()

The example above is the minimum required to generate a map. All other examples are available in the `examples` folder.

Once the map is generated, the output folder will contain all the necessary files which can be served locally using the `run_local.sh` script. The script is available in the `data_out` folder. To serve the map locally navigate to the `data_out` folder in a terminal shell and run the provided utility: 
    
    ./run_local.sh

or, you can simply run a python server at a desired port:

    python -m http.server <PORT_NUM>
  
### The `data_out` folder

This folder is generated by py2mappr. Following are the contents:
    
    index.html              # entry point. has references to the openmappr player resources (js/css/images etc)
    data/
        nodes.json          # node data with attributes metadata
        links.json          # links data with attributes metadata
        settings.json       # global settings for the player
    run_local.sh            # simple utility to run a local server

## API

py2mappr contains 2 main modules:
* mappr
* publish

### mappr

This module contains the main API to generate a map. In order to import the module, use the following:

    from py2mappr import mappr

It also contains the following helper methods:
* `create_map(..)`: creates a map from the given data
* `create_layout(..)`: creates a layout object and attaches to the project
* `show()`: opens the map in the browser

#### `create_map(..)`
This method is the main method to generate a map. It accepts the following arguments:

* data_frame: `DataFrame`, required. The data frame of datapoints with its attributes (columns) to be used in the project.
* network_df: `DataFrame`, optional. The data frame of edges with its
    attributes (columns) to be used in the project. Noting that the `network_df` is optional in this method, but it is expected to be set for the project, which can be done using `set_network(..)`.
* layout_type: `str`, optional. The type of the layout to be created as the first layout in the project. The default is "clustered". Available values are: `clustered`, `scatterplot`, `clustered-scatterplot`, `geo`.

#### `create_layout(..)`
This method is used to create a layout object and attach it to the project. It accepts the following arguments:

* data_frame: `DataFrame`, optional. The data frame of datapoints with its attributes (columns) to be used in the project. Should be provided if there is no current project.

* layout_type: `PLOT_TYPE`, optional. The type of the layout to be created. The default is "clustered". The available types are: `clustered` `scatterplot`, `clustered-scatterplot`, `geo`.

### publish

This module contains the API to publish the map to the local system or cloud storage. In order to import the module, use the following:

    import py2mappr.publish as publisher

It provides the API to run the publishing tasks in predefined order.

#### Run on local system
    
        publisher.run([
            publisher.local()
        ])

The call above will build the current project and pass the current project path to the `local` task. The `local` task will start the server using `http.server` and open the map in the browser.

#### Publish on S3

        publisher.run([
            publisher.s3("my-bucket-name")
        ])

The call above will build the current project and pass the current project path to the `s3` task. The `s3` task will fetch the AWS credentials from the `config.ini` file of the current python project and upload the project to the given bucket.

#### Publish on S3 and set up CloudFront distribution

        publisher.run([
            publisher.s3("my-bucket-name"),
            publisher.cloudfront("cdn.mydomain.com")
        ])

The call above will build the current project and pass the current project path to the `s3` task. The `s3` task will fetch the AWS credentials from the `config.ini` file of the current python project and upload the project to the given bucket. The bucket name will be passed to the `cloudfront` tasks, which will create a new distribution for the given bucket with an alias of `cdn.mydomain.com`.

#### Expanding the publish flow

Custom tasks can be added to the publish flow. The custom task should be a function that accepts the dict of values returned by the previous task. The following is an example of a custom task:

        def my_custom_task(data):
            print("my custom task")
            print("project path: ", data.get("web_dir"))

        publisher.run([
            my_custom_task
        ])

The following values can be accessed from the `data` dict:
* `web_dir`: the path to the project folder
* `bucket`: the name of the s3 bucket, returned from the `s3` task
* `cdn_url`: the url of the cloudfront distribution, returned from the `cloudfront` task
